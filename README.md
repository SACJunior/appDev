We are going to be spending the rest of the year creating a mobile webApp. This is essentially a website that is responsive (responds to the size of the screen) on any device (mobile or desktop). If we make a few other changes to our HTML it will also be possible to bookmark it on an iOS device and it will essentially run like an app and you will not have to make any updates through the Apple App Store. 

Your mobile app must have the following features:

you must write the HTML yourself (although you are free to get ideas from other websites)
you must have an external CSS file that styles your HTML
your website must be responsive 
your website must be hosted on Github (username.github.io) - this is where I will check your work (see Assignment)
You will get extra marks if your website is also:

interactive - this means using JavaScript or jQuery to make it interactive. There is a codecademy course on jQuery.
iOS friendly
An excellent resource for writing your HTML and CSS is the w3 schools website - I use this all the time when I forget some aspect of my coding or syntax requirements (covers all aspects of HTML, CSS and JavaScript / jQuery).

Content of your WebApp:
The content of your app is totally up to you - if you are wanting to be creating a game, this is going to be much more difficult as it is going to require interactivity (jQuery will be necessary). If you are wanting to just present information then this is going to be much easier (e.g. info and pictures about your favourite football team, the Western Sydney Wanderers). Feel free to come and speak to me about your idea and I can tell you what is going to be required.
